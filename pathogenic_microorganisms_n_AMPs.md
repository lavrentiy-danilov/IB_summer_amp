**Introduction**

Nature provides a variety of peptides that are expressed in most living species. In the project we have focused on marine peptides (antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) extracted from marine species to be exact).

AMPs can have a range of activities: from killing bacteria, to immune modulation or preventing biofilm formation, as well as anti-cancer or anti-viral properties.

**Finding some human pathogenic microorganisms**

Here we have tried to select some human pathogenic microorganisms and conclude which AMPs (antimicrobial peptides) extracted from marine organisms work against them.

We have found the following human pathogenic microorganisms and diseases caused by them:
1) **Micrococcus luteus** can act as an opportunistic pathogen. It has been associated with a variety of illnesses including meningitis, septic arthritis, endocarditis, chronic cutaneous infections in HIV positive patients, and catheter infections.
2) **Bacillus megaterium** causes brain abscess.
3) **Staphylococcus aureus** causes skin infections, pneumonia, heart valve infections, and bone infections.
4) **Microbacterium maritypicum** causes infective endocarditis.
5) **Bacillus subtilis** causes bacteremia, endocarditis, pneumonia, and septicemia.
6) **Escherichia coli** is one of the most frequent causes of many common bacterial infections, including cholecystitis, bacteremia, cholangitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), and traveler's diarrhea, and other clinical infections such as neonatal meningitis and pneumonia.
7) **Pseudomonas aeruginosa** causes infections in the blood, lungs (pneumonia).
8) **Listeria monocytogenes** causes listeriosis that manifests itself as sepsis, meningitis, encephalitis, intrauterine infections and spontaneous abortions in pregnant women.

**Finding the appropriate AMPs for the listed pathogenic microorganisms plus identification of mode of action (MOA) for each AMP**

The main databases for searching well-known AMPs that were selected for this project are DRAMP (http://dramp.cpu-bioinfor.org/downloads/), Antimicrobial Peptide Database (https://aps.unmc.edu/database/), and CAMPR3 (http://www.camp3.bicnirrh.res.in/index.php). As a result, Table 1 which describes AMPs killing the described microorganisms was created. Moreover, modes of action (MOA) for the listed AMPs were described: it is important to understand AMP's MOA to facilitate further development as therapeutic agents.

| Mode of action (MOA) | Effects on both the outer and cytoplasmic membrane of bacterium. Damicornin exerts its antimicrobial effects via perturbation of the cell membrane of bacterium. | Parasin I localizes to the cell membrane and subsequently permeabilized the outer and cytoplasmic membranes. | Arasin 1 is characterized by dual mode of action involving membrane disruption at peptide concentrations above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), and an alternative mechanism of action, possibly involving intracellular targets, at MIC. | MjPen-II can bind to bacterial surface polysaccharides to promote bacterial agglutination. | Arenicin-1 disrupts membranes of bacterial cells. |
| Pathogenic microorganism(s) | Micrococcus luteus; Bacillus megaterium; Staphylococcus aureus; Microbacterium maritypicum | Bacillus subtilis | Escherichia coli | Pseudomonas aeruginosa | Listeria monocytogenes |

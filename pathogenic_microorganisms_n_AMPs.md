**Finding top 5 human pathogenic microorganisms**

Here I have tried to select some human pathogenic microorganisms (up to 5) and conclude which AMPs (Antimicrobial peptides) extracted from marine organisms work against them.

P.S. It is also possible there to look at pathogenic bacteria that are related to bacterial diseases of potato/barley.

I have found the following human pathogenic microorganisms and diseases caused by them:
1) **Aspergillus fumigatus** causes chronic lung disease (chronic pulmonary aspergillosis) and life-threatening systemic infection that can involve multiple organs (invasive aspergillosis).
2) **Vibrio Fluvialis** causes cholera-like bloody diarrhoea.
3) -
4) -
5) -

**Finding the appropriate AMPs for the listed pathogenic bacteria**

The main database for searching AMPs that was selected for this project is DRAMP (http://dramp.cpu-bioinfor.org/downloads/). The general AMPs dataset was chosen. As a result, Table 1 which describes AMPs killing the described bacteria was created:
| Pathogenic microorganism | Aspergillus fumigatus | Vibrio Fluvialis | n | n | n |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| AMP(s) | Antifungal peptide [marine snail Cenchritis muricatus] | Hepcidin [fish like atlantic cod Gadus morhua, antarctic toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni,  atlantic salmon Salmo salar, etc.] | :---: | :---: | :---: |

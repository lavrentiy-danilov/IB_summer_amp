**Finding some human pathogenic microorganisms**

Here we have tried to select some human pathogenic microorganisms (/up to 5 related to corals AMPs section/ + /3/ additional related to other marine species for comparison) and conclude which AMPs (antimicrobial peptides) extracted from marine organisms work against them.

We have found the following human pathogenic microorganisms and diseases caused by them:
1) **Micrococcus luteus** can act as an opportunistic pathogen. It has been associated with a variety of illnesses including meningitis, septic arthritis, endocarditis, chronic cutaneous infections in HIV positive patients, and catheter infections.
2) **Bacillus megaterium** causes brain abscess.
3) **Staphylococcus aureus** causes skin infections, pneumonia, heart valve infections, and bone infections.
4) **Microbacterium maritypicum** causes infective endocarditis.
5) **/sponges/**
6) **/sponges/**
7) **Aspergillus fumigatus** causes chronic lung disease (chronic pulmonary aspergillosis) and life-threatening systemic infection that can involve multiple organs (invasive aspergillosis).
8) **Vibrio Fluvialis** causes cholera-like bloody diarrhoea.
9) **Listeria monocytogenes** causes listeriosis that manifests itself as sepsis, meningitis, encephalitis, intrauterine infections and spontaneous abortions in pregnant women.

**Finding the appropriate AMPs for the listed pathogenic microorganisms**

The main database for searching AMPs that was selected for this project is DRAMP (http://dramp.cpu-bioinfor.org/downloads/). The general AMPs dataset was chosen. As a result, Table 1 which describes AMPs killing the described bacteria was created:
| AMP | Damicornin [scleractinian coral Pocillopora damicornis] | Antifungal peptide [marine snail Cenchritis muricatus] | Hepcidin [fish like atlantic cod Gadus morhua, antarctic toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni,  atlantic salmon Salmo salar, etc.] | Arenicin-1 (Ar-1) [marine polychaeta] |
| Mechanism of action for AMP  | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Pathogenic microorganism(s) | Micrococcus luteus; Bacillus megaterium; Staphylococcus aureus; Microbacterium maritypicum | Aspergillus fumigatus | Vibrio Fluvialis | Listeria monocytogenes |

Here I have tried to select the most pathogenic bacteria (up to 5) and conclude which AMPs (Antimicrobial peptides) work against them.
P.S. It is also possible there to look at pathogenic bacteria that are related to bacterial diseases of potato/barley.

I have found the following major human pathogens and reference bacteria:
1) **Neisseria meningitidis (Betaproteobacteria)** causes meningitis, septicemia, Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome.
2) **Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Betaproteobacteria)** causes gonorrhea.
3) **Haemophilus influenzae (Gammaproteobacteria)** causes pneumonia, meningitis, bacteremia, otitis media, etc.
4) **Streptococcus pneumoniae (Bacilli)** causes pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, peritonitis, pericarditis, meningitis, brain abscess, etc.
5) **Helicobacter pylori (Epsilonproteobacteria)** causes peptic ulcer and gastric cancer.

**Finding top 5 human pathogenic microorganisms**

Here I have tried to select some human pathogenic microorganisms (up to 5) and conclude which AMPs (Antimicrobial peptides) extracted from marine organisms work against them.
P.S. It is also possible there to look at pathogenic bacteria that are related to bacterial diseases of potato/barley.

I have found the following human pathogenic microorganisms and diseases caused by them:
1) **Aspergillus fumigatus** causes chronic lung disease (chronic pulmonary aspergillosis) and life-threatening systemic infection that can involve multiple organs (invasive aspergillosis).
2) **Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Betaproteobacteria)** causes gonorrhea.
3) **Haemophilus influenzae (Gammaproteobacteria)** causes pneumonia, meningitis, bacteremia, otitis media, etc.
4) **Streptococcus pneumoniae (Bacilli)** causes pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, peritonitis, pericarditis, meningitis, brain abscess, etc.
5) **Helicobacter pylori (Epsilonproteobacteria)** causes peptic ulcer and gastric cancer.

Information was retrieved from the article of Ole Herman Ambur "Genome dynamics in major bacterial pathogens" (Table 1 "Characteristics of major human pathogens and reference bacteria included in the study") / DOI:10.1111/j.1574-6976.2009.00173.x.

**Finding the appropriate AMPs for the listed pathogenic bacteria**

The main database for searching AMPs that was selected for this project is DRAMP (http://dramp.cpu-bioinfor.org/downloads/). The general AMPs dataset was chosen. As a result, Table 1 which describes AMPs killing the described bacteria was created:
| Pathogenic microorganism | Aspergillus fumigatus | Neisseria gonorrhoeae | Haemophilus influenzae | Streptococcus pneumoniae | Helicobacter pylori |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| AMP(s) | Antifungal peptide [marine snail Cenchritis muricatus] | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

**Finding top 5 human pathogenic bacteria**

Here I have tried to select the most pathogenic bacteria (up to 5) and conclude which AMPs (Antimicrobial peptides) work against them.
P.S. It is also possible there to look at pathogenic bacteria that are related to bacterial diseases of potato/barley.

I have found the following major human pathogens and reference bacteria:
1) **Neisseria meningitidis (Betaproteobacteria)** causes meningitis, septicemia, Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome.
2) **Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Betaproteobacteria)** causes gonorrhea.
3) **Haemophilus influenzae (Gammaproteobacteria)** causes pneumonia, meningitis, bacteremia, otitis media, etc.
4) **Streptococcus pneumoniae (Bacilli)** causes pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, peritonitis, pericarditis, meningitis, brain abscess, etc.
5) **Helicobacter pylori (Epsilonproteobacteria)** causes peptic ulcer and gastric cancer.

Information was retrieved from the article of Ole Herman Ambur "Genome dynamics in major bacterial pathogens" (Table 1 "Characteristics of major human pathogens and reference bacteria included in the study") / DOI:10.1111/j.1574-6976.2009.00173.x.

**Finding the appropriate AMPs for the listed pathogenic bacteria**

The main database for searching AMPs that was selected for this project is DRAMP (http://dramp.cpu-bioinfor.org/downloads/). The general AMPs dataset was chosen. As a result, the Table 1 which describes AMPs killing the described bacteria was created:
